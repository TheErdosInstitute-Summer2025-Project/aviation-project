Contributing to the accident was the failure of the flight crewmembers to address the fact that the helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on their two prior departures from the accident site because they were accustomed to operating at the limit of the helicopter’s performance. 

Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire that resulted from the spillage of fuel upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the cabin seat restraints.","Aircraft - Aircraft handling/service - Loading - (general) - Related operating info, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Aircraft capability - (general) - Related operating info, Organizational issues - Management - Culture - Standard operating practices - Operator, Personnel issues - Experience/knowledge - Knowledge - (general) - Pilot, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - Other government, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Lack of action - Flight crew, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Fuel system - Fuel storage - Design, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Equipment/furnishings - Flight compartment equipment - Design, Aircraft - Fluids/misc hardware - Fluids - Fuel - Fluid condition, Environmental issues - Conditions/weather/phenomena - Wind - (general) - Availability of related info, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Indicating/recording systems - Data recorders (flight/maint) - Not installed/available",,"40.914164999999997","-123.25250200000001","SIKORSKY","S-61N","HELI",,,"false",,"TS",,"PUBF","PUBU","Destroyed","VMC","USDA Forest Service","Initial Climb","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=68616","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/LAX08PA259.aspx"
