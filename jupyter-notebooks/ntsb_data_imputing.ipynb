    "#### Notes \n",
    "- Since we don't want to drop columns based on their frequency in the test set, this is probably a temporary measure to simplify our exploration, but we can take it out once we have a model\n",
    "- The following should be run __before__ drop infrequent values, which fills in missing entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually when we impute values, I think we should do so __before__ dropping any columns / infrequent values of categorical variables because we may use that information in imputation even if we don't use it in modeling. E.g. if we only two occurences of a particular aircraft model, that could still be useful for imputing missing info about the aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `total_person_count`\n",
    "We have some missing data for `total_person_count`, which can mostly be calculated, but:\n",
    "1. there are a few (~10) cases where we're missing data for both aircraft in a multi-aircraft event. \n",
    "2. if `inj_tot_t` and aircraft-level counts are missing and the other event-level injury counts are 0, this does not necessarily indicate that there were only unmanned aircraft involved. It seems that the other event-level injury counts default to 0 when they are unknown, and only `inj_tot_t` is left blank in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found the following reasons why the injury counts might be unknown:\n",
    "- Crash occurred outside of the USA --> no NTSB investigation\n",
    "- Incident and not accident --> superficial investigation\n",
    "- Aircraft damage was discovered in an inspection --> investigation could not determine whether injuries occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering data\n",
    "- I think we should filter out (a) events outside the USA and (b) non-accidents because of a high likelihood of sparse data. This leaves us with ~83% of the data. \n",
    "- If we do this, most of the variables now have well over 80% of the values present\n",
    "- My gut is to filter before the train-test split, but I'm not certain that's right (or that it matters)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other notes\n",
    "- Oddly, `gust_kts` is 100% present but `wind_vel_kts` is ~20% missing. When `wind_vel_kts` is missing, `gust_kts` is 0 more than 99% of the time, which probably means that 0 is entered by default when it's unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imputing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical\n",
    "- Target variables (does it ever make sense to impute a target variable, or should we just omit from the dataset / performance metrics?)\n",
    "  - `damage`: guess based on injury severity \n",
    "  - `ev_highest_injury`: calculate from injury counts\n",
    "- All others: 'other/unknown'\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical\n",
    "- Calculate from other data: `total_person_count`, `Minor_count`, `None_count`, `Serious_count`, `Fatal_count`, `injured_person_count`, `ev_highest_injury`, `inj_tot_t`\n",
    "- `latitude`, `longitude`: randomly sample? (not a huge issue -- it's only 1 row)\n",
    "- `Environmental issues`, `Organizational issues`, `Personnel issues`: impute 0\n",
    "- `num_eng`: find max number of passengers on a 1-engine aircraft, impute 1 for aircraft with at most this many passengers, 2 for aircraft with more passengers"
